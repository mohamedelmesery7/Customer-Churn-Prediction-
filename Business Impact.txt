Model Interpretation

For the Exited (Churned) class:

The model correctly identifies 61 out of every 100 customers who actually leave (Recall = 61%).

Out of every 100 customers the model predicts will churn, 58 are correct while 42 remain loyal (Precision = 58%).


Business Case Simulation

To illustrate the business value of this model in a FinTech context, consider the following assumptions:

The model predicts 250 customers as potential churners.

The average revenue per customer (Customer Lifetime Value) is $2,000.

The cost of a retention voucher (offered to predicted churners) is $170.

1. Mathematical Analysis

True Positives (TP): 250×0.58=145 → customers correctly identified as churners.




False Positives (FP): 250-145 =105 → customers incorrectly predicted as churners (false alarms).



False Negatives (FN):
From recall: FN+TP=145/0.61=237
          ⇒ FN=237−145=92 → actual churners missed by the model.




2. Business Interpretation (In Ideal Case)

Without the model:
The company would lose all 237 churners.
→ Total loss = 237×2000=$474,000


With the model:

92 customers still churn (missed by the model).

250 vouchers are sent (cost = 250×170=$42,500)

→ Total cost = (92×2000)+42,500=$226,500


Financial Savings: 474,000−226,500=$248,500


Conclusion

The model demonstrates strong business value, reducing potential churn-related losses by approximately $248,500.
Although the precision and recall indicate room for improvement, the model already provides a positive financial 
return and can be further optimized through better feature engineering, rebalancing techniques, and targeted marketing interventions.
