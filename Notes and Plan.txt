Notes about the Data

1- A considerable proportion of customers who churn have a credit score between 600 and 700, indicating that mid-range credit scores may be associated with higher churn risk.

2- The highest churn rate is observed among customers aged 30 to 40, after which the rate declines progressively with age.

3- A substantial share of churned customers have a zero account balance, followed by another notable group with high balances ranging between $100,000 and $150,000.

4- Customers from Germany demonstrate the highest churn rate, approximately 32%, suggesting a potential regional factor influencing churn behavior.

5- Female customers show a higher tendency to churn compared to males; however, the overall number of male customers exceeds that of females in the dataset.

6-Customers holding 3 or 4 products exhibit an unusually high churn rate — with 100% of customers having 4 products recorded as churned. This finding is unusual but may be attributed to the very small percentage of customers in this category.


Customer Retention Plan:

Objective:
Reduce customer churn by strategically engaging at-risk customer segments identified through data analysis.

1. Focus on German Customers

Actions:

Implement a localized marketing campaign in Germany emphasizing loyalty rewards, personalized financial solutions, and the long-term value of our banking services.

Establish a dedicated German-speaking customer support line to enhance service quality, address issues promptly, and build stronger customer relationships.


2. Strengthen Engagement with Female Customers

Actions:

Develop tailored financial products and bundles designed to meet the needs and aspirations of female customers, such as investment workshops, savings plans, or family-oriented financial packages.

Implement targeted communication strategies (via email, in-app notifications, and social media) that highlight relevant benefits, promote financial empowerment, and reinforce trust.


3. Address Churn Among “Zero Balance” and “High Balance” Customers

For Zero Balance Customers:

Introduce no-fee or low-fee basic accounts and provide incentives such as bonus interest or cashback for first deposits or activating direct deposit options.

For High Balance Customers ($100K–$150K):

Assign dedicated personal banking advisors and offer premium-tier services, exclusive investment opportunities, and preferential interest rates to enhance perceived value and loyalty.


4. Reassess Product Bundling Strategy

Actions:

Conduct an in-depth analysis to determine why customers with three or more products exhibit higher churn rates—potentially due to product overlap or service inefficiencies.

Initiate proactive portfolio reviews for customers holding multiple products, ensuring alignment with their financial goals and simplifying their product mix when necessary.


5. Engage the 30–40 Age Segment

Actions:

Launch digital-first financial solutions that align with the lifestyle and preferences of this tech-savvy demographic.

Offer advanced mobile banking features, goal-based savings tools, and streamlined mortgage pre-approval processes to enhance convenience and strengthen engagement.
